Hand Cricket Scoring Game
This is a simple Python program that allows two players to play a game of hand cricket and keep track of their scores. In hand cricket, one player bats while the other bowls, and the batting player scores runs by making specific hand signs. The goal is to score as many runs as possible before getting out.

Dependencies
This program utilizes the following Python libraries:

OpenCV (cv2): Used for capturing and displaying video frames.
cvzone: A library for hand tracking, which is used to detect and analyze hand gestures.
Make sure you have these libraries installed before running the code.

Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Ensure that you have a webcam connected to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code.

How to Play
Two players take turns batting and bowling.

The player currently batting will make hand gestures to score runs.

The following hand gestures correspond to runs:

Fist (0 runs)
One finger up (1 run)
Two fingers up (2 runs)
Three fingers up (3 runs)
Four fingers up (4 runs)
All fingers up (5 runs)
Thumb up (6 runs)
To score runs, the batting player must make the corresponding hand sign and press the "Space" bar.

The program will keep track of the runs scored by each player and display the scores on the screen.

To switch players (i.e., change the batting and bowling roles), press the "Enter" key.

The game continues until you decide to quit by pressing the "q" key.

Controls
Press "Space" to record a hand sign and score runs.
Press "Enter" to switch players (only when waiting for player swap).
Press "q" to quit the game.
Scoring
Player 1's score is displayed as "Player 1 Score" on the screen.
Player 2's score is displayed as "Player 2 Score" on the screen.
The current batting player is displayed as "Current Player."
